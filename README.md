# ZahRu
Zahru is basically a new tab/start page, which I created in my spare time to get my hands on JS.

The latter is free to use within the limits of the GNU General Public License v3.0.

~~My vocation is to continue to develop ZahRu over time.~~ 
Well... to be honest, I had quite a few little ideas, but the removal of the Unsplash support has demotivated me for now ^^
